    <h3>Plants</h3>
    <p id="text">Hello everybody!
    </br>Well, I think you have already familiarized yourself with the precondition and are ready to
  </br>immerse yourself in the facts and learn something new.
  </br>But in order to learn something, you need to understand what it is all about. We will start with nature.
</br>Nature is the material world of the planet, the main object of study, and in general this is all that surrounds us.
</br>And since we touched on the theme of nature, then let's talk about plants. Let's start with the simplest grass.
</br>The grass has leaves and stems that die off at the end of the seasonal period, it can be either two-cell or one.
</br>We figured it out, but I think many people wondered, here we have grass dying in the winter and growing
</br>again in the summer every year, and what happens in countries where there is no winter,
</br>what grass is there and does it die there? We already know that annuals die off in winter and
</br>grow in summer but what happens to perennials about which you will now find out.
</br>In perennial grasses, underground or creeping shoots on the earth exist for several or many years,
</br>and aboveground shoots last for one year. Overhead shoots do not lignify and die off completely,
</br>and new shoots grow back. We want us to talk about different species if you like this topic.
</br>And the next topic will be about astronomy.
</br></br>Thank you for visiting our site!</p>
