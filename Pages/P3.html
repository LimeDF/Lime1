    <h3>Uran</h3>
    <p id="text">Good day friends!
    </br>Today we have astronomy. According to our tradition,
  </br>we will first understand what astronomy and the planet are.
</br>A planet is a celestial body revolving around its orbit. Astronomy is the science of planets,
</br>solar systems, constellations, and so on. We will analyze the planet Uranus.
</br>Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun, third in diameter and fourth in mass,
</br>was discovered in 1781 by the English astronomer William Herschel. Well, we move on to research.
</br>Uranium salts emit some invisible radiation exposing photosensitive materials; at that time,
</br>this observation went unnoticed. In 1896, exploring uranium, the French scientist Antoine Andri Bekkerel
</br>accidentally discovered radioactive decay. At the same time, the French chemist Andri Moussan
</br>was able to develop a method for producing pure metallic uranium.
</br>In 1899, Ernest Rutherford discovered that the radiation of uranium preparations is heterogeneous,
</br>that there are two types of radiation - alpha and beta rays. They carry a different electric charge;
</br>their range in substance and ionizing ability are far from identical. In May 1900,
</br>Paul Villard discovered the third type of radiation - gamma rays.
</br>And thatâ€™s all, I think that here is the most interesting, thanks for your attention!
