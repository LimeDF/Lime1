    <h3>Animals</h3>
    <p id="text">Hello!
    </br>Today we discuss animals, their structure and how they differ.
</br>But let's start with the designation, who are these animals?
</br>The distinguished category of organisms is currently regarded as a biological nucleus.
</br>Animals are the main object of study of zoology.
</br>The main principle of difference from plants is that animals can move themselves.
</br>Now the name "animals" in the taxonomic sense is fixed to multicellular.
</br>At the same time, in science the term “animals” is sometimes proposed to be used in an even broader sense,
</br>meaning not animals as taxa, but a type of organization - a life form based on mobility.
